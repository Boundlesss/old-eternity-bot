# Eternity Bot (OLD)
###### NOTE: THIS IS OLD SOURCE CODE FOR MY DISCORD BOT, WHICH IS INDEED NOW REWRITTEN. THIS CODE MAY/MAY NOT BE FUNCTIONAL.

Old source code for a old bot. Basically, I am deciding to release the old source code because I may keep it as a "archive" or something. This was also part of my "beginner" stage, when I was just getting the grips of working with `discord.js`.

The code is all yours basically. You can probably try to work off it, or just use it as a reference. I don't recommend either because the code is poorly written and ineffecient.

You will only need:
 - Discord.js
 - Chalk (Coloring in your terminal/shell)
